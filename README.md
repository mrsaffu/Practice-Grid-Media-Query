## üìò Media Queries: Make Your Design Responsive

### üîç What is a Media Query?

A **media query** lets you apply CSS styles based on the user's device screen size, resolution, or orientation. It's the key to making your websites responsive.

### ‚úÖ Syntax:

```css
@media (condition) {
  /* CSS styles here */
}



## üõ† Common Media Features:


| Feature       | Description                                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `max-width`   | Applies styles if screen width is **less than or equal to** a value    |
| `min-width`   | Applies styles if screen width is **greater than or equal to** a value |
| `orientation` | Detects **portrait** or **landscape** mode                             |
| `resolution`  | Targets screen resolution (e.g. `300dpi`)                              |
```

### Example :

@media (max-width: 768px) {
.container {
flex-direction: column;
}
}

## üöÄ What is CSS Grid?

**CSS Grid** is a layout system in CSS that allows you to arrange content in **rows and columns**. It gives you full control over layout structure, making it ideal for responsive and complex designs.

---

## üì¶ Basic Example

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 20px;
}
```

This example creates a 3-column layout with equal widths and a gap of 20px between grid items.
